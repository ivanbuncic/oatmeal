**Method:**

1.  **Prepare the Dry Mix:**
    
    *   In a bowl, combine the wholegrain oats, chia seeds, flaxseeds, and buckwheat. This will be the hearty base of your porridge, packed with fibre and nutrients.
2.  **Cooking the Porridge:**
    
    *   Bring 300 ml of water or your preferred milk to a boil in a saucepan.
    *   Stir in the dry mix.
    *   Let it simmer on low heat until it reaches your desired consistency (about 5-7 minutes). Keep an eye on it—nobody likes burnt porridge!
3.  **Adding the Flavours:**
    
    *   In a separate frying pan, cook the smoked bacon strips until they're delightfully crispy.
    *   Add the diced red bell pepper and sauté until softened.
    *   Toss in the cherry tomatoes and olives, cooking for another minute. Feel free to channel your inner chef and give it a flamboyant flip—just mind the ceiling.
4.  **Bringing It All Together:**
    
    *   Spoon the porridge into a bowl (or a fancy dish if you're feeling posh).
    *   Top it with the bacon and vegetable mixture.
    *   Garnish with the white cheese cubes with herbs. Voilà!
5.  **Serve and Enjoy:**
    
    *   Your ultimate porridge is ready to be devoured. Grab a spoon and tuck in before someone else does!
